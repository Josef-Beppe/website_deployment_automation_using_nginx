# Website Deployment Automation Using NGINX
Project is meant to automate a simple static website deployment. That is done in two independent ways - using ansible and docker. Documentation for each of the sub-projects is located in the appropriate folders.

The idea is, that a web developer would progressively update a content of github repository, hosting the (now) website source code. And a server, providing the web to the internet, would be able to update the content with minimal or completely without human interaction.

Project functionality was tested on clean VMs running Ubuntu 22.04.1 and Debian 11.5.0.
